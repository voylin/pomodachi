## Contributing code
We welcome code contributions! Please follow these steps to make contributions go more smoothly:

### Project overview
Pomodachi is an open-source Pomodoro timer and activity tracker developed using the Godot game engine (we follow the stable version releases). The primary language used is GDScript. The project is licensed under the MIT license.

### Setting up your development enviroment
1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Get the latest stable version of [the Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org);
    * Install git;
    * Familiarity with GDScript and Godot workflow ([Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/));
1. **Fork the repo:**
    * [Fork the Pomodachi project from GitHub](https://github.com/voylin/pomodachi/fork) to create your own copy of Pomodachi to work in;
    * Clone your fork to your local machine
1. **Open project in Godot:**
    * Opening the project can be done through launching Godot and opening the project which is inside the `src` folder.

### Your first code contribution
1. Make certain you have pulled all commits from upstream and that you are inside of the `master` branch;
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the feature or bug fix you want to implement;
1. Make your changes, write your code, fix bugs, ...;
1. Test your changes, be certain that it doesn't break anything else and that it works as expected;
1. Follow the coding style, there's no document yet outlining the style so base it upon the other scripts for now;
1. Write a clear commit message about the change you made;
1. Commit and push your changes, afterwards create a pull request;

From there we will review the code and test it ourselves as well. If everything is okay, we merge the PR. If not, we will ask for some changes to happen. Once merged: Congratulations, you've contributed to Pomodachi!
