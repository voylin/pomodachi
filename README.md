# Pomodachi - ALPHA
_A pomodoro timer made with Godot._
Pomodachi is in alpha right now, it'll get more features as time goes on, there's a roadmap, but for the first few stages I want to focus on usability first.

## Road-map
- [ ] Simple timer functionality;
- [ ] Create icon;
- [ ] Add AUR install;
- [ ] Have preset times (change-able);
- [ ] Tracking of what you've been working on (activities);
- [ ] Graphs to show tracked progress (by day/month/year);
- [ ] Add different alarm sounds;
- [ ] Add activity setting to change alarm sounds;
- [ ] Add different backgrounds which change with the season;
- [ ] Minimize build size;
- [ ] Android build;
- [ ] Windows build;
- [ ] MacOS build;
- [ ] Tracking progress export (CSV/JSON);
- [ ] Tracking progress syncing;
- [ ] Itch.io page;
